## Introduction

It's been a hard year for Santa, so he's not had much of an opportunity to make a list, and he certainly has had no time to check it twice! To help Santa out, you're going to make a sentiment analysis bot that can look over a Twitter user's last 200 tweets and make a decision about whether they are naughty or nice.

This is a fairly advanced project and is best suited for learners with reasonable experience in a programming language,

You will need a Twitter account to do the project, and to be legally allowed to have an account, you need to be at least 13 years of age. The project uses a live stream of tweets, which might contain profanity or inappropriate language, so it is best suited for older learners.

### What you will make

Here's a little example video showing the output of the program:
