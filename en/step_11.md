## Challenge: making it interactive

You could make a little more use of the Twitter API in this project.

+ How about making your bot listen in on your own stream? Then if somebody tweets you to ask whether an individual user was naughty or nice, the bot could do the calculations automatically, and then tweet the result back to the person. It could even @Santa in the message!
