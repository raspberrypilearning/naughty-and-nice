## Challenge: Making it interactive

You could use the Twitter API a little more for this project. How about making your bot listen in on your own stream. If somebody then asks you if an individual user was Naughty or Nice, by tweeting you, the bot could do the calculations and then come tweet back to the person the result. They could even @Santa in the message.
